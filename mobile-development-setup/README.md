# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this document is to log the setup process for a mobile development environment using the **Expo Framework** for React Native. This approach simplifies development and testing, bypassing the need for resource-heavy device emulators.

This log documents the tools installed and the steps taken to get the **Expo Go** application running on a physical device.

## üì± Expo Go Installation and Setup

The primary goal of this task was to install and configure the Expo Go application, which is used to run and test React Native apps directly on a physical device.

### Why Expo Go?

Expo Go provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for testing. It allows for live reloading and development on a physical device (both iOS and Android) without requiring the installation and maintenance of heavy emulators for every possible device model.

### Setup Process Log

Here is the documentation of the steps taken to install Expo Go:

1.  **Device Used:** [Your Phone Model, e.g., Google Pixel 8 (Android 14) or iPhone 15 (iOS 17)]
2.  **Visited Download Page:** I navigated to the official Expo Go homepage at `https://expo.dev/go`.
3.  **Installed Application:**
    * The website automatically detected my device type and provided a link to the correct app store.
    * I installed **Expo Go** from the [Google Play Store / Apple App Store].
4.  **App Configuration:**
    * I opened the Expo Go application on my device.
    * I was prompted to log in or create an account.
    * I successfully **created a new Expo account** and logged in within the app.

**Status:** The Expo Go app is now installed, authenticated, and ready to scan a project QR code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

This section documents any issues encountered during the setup process.

* **[No Major Issues Encountered]**
    * **Description:** The installation process via the app store was straightforward. The account creation and login process was smooth and worked as expected. No troubleshooting was required.

*(If you faced an issue, you can replace the section above with something like this):*

* **[Example Challenge: Account Verification Email Delay]**
    * **Description:** After signing up for a new Expo account, the verification email took over 10 minutes to arrive.
    * **Solution:** I used the "Resend Email" feature, which delivered the email immediately. This resolved the issue, and I was able to log in.
